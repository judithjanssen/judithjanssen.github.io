In the last focus retreat, one of the participants, showed us a video with the words: “the guy is REALLY convincing”. And I have to say, Antje, he is :)

Bottom-line: **You're awesome**. That´s what I am, what you are, what we all are: awesome, according to the guy from the video. 

I don't need some guy to tell me that I am fantastic and awesome, but, I know that **I don't tell myself this often enough**. I practice to be kind to myself but I also know that somehow (and unconsciously) it's much easier to invalidate myself. So I reckoned it would be good to watch this video from time to time and to put the message on my bathroom mirror to remind me everyday.

Why? Because I am what I tell myself.

Act of love: listen to this message as many times as I need to feel incredibly empowered.
