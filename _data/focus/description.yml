  subtitle: 'Attention, in all its varieties, has a very powerful influence on the way we feel and the way we move through life. '
  paragraphs:
    - '<strong>The internal focus helps us connect with our intuitions and values</strong> that guide us, favoring the process of decision making; the external focus helps us navigate the world around us; and focus on others improves our social life.'
    - 'Modern society however, does not facilitate the cultivation of attention.'
    - 'The speeded-up, highly complex society we live in, where <strong>we have a non-stop stream of distractions coming in</strong> through our smartphones and laptops feeds our so-called <em>monkey mind</em>, with very short attention spans and scattered thoughts.'
    - 'The good news is: <strong>you can train your brain</strong>! (and your body while you are at it :)'
    - '<strong>I invite you to step into the miraculous world that is your body and mind</strong>, become close, and start refining your inner focus.'
