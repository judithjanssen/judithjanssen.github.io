    <p class="large text-muted">I was born and raised in the Netherlands and currently live in Spain with my boyfriend and two kids. I went through the whole package: university, travelling and working at a multinational company. I felt a bit disorientated and disconnected from what I really wanted in life. Then, I came across yoga and it was quite a revelation. Yoga became my passion and later my profession.</p>
    <h4 class="text-muted">My approach to yoga</h4>
    <p class="large text-muted">We live in a culture where the motto is “no pain no gain”. Yes, the feeling that you get after a tough workout is great, but <strong>a lot of workouts can be harmful for your body, and even for your self-image</strong>.</p>
    <p class="large text-muted">Even yoga, when practised in a disrespectful way can cause harm to your body, and injury. So, for me, one of <strong>the key things in yoga is respect for your body</strong>. You <em>can</em> have a tough and exhilarating yoga workout, but always within the boundaries that your body, your constitution sets.</p>
    <p class="large text-muted">I think we <strong>better work for self-acceptance than for self-improvement</strong>, and cultivate a constructive and loving attitude towards ourselves.</p>
    <p class="large text-muted">I <strong>focus on body awareness, proper breathing and proper postural alignment</strong>. My teaching is an integration of Hatha yoga with the precision and props of Iyengar yoga, the dynamics of Vinyasa flow and other body movement and expression techniques.</p>
