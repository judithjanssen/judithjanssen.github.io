    My name is Judith Janssen. I am a qualified childbirth educator and doula, pre & postnatal yoga teacher and second-year midwife in training. I speak Dutch, English and Spanish fluently and support international families giving birth in and around Maastricht.  
    </p>
    <p class="large text-muted">
    I have lived abroad for more than ten years and gave birth to my two sons while living in Spain. Being pregnant and giving birth is an amazing and exciting journey, that can come with challenges especially if you live abroad.

    <p class="large text-muted">
    My intention is to empower women to trust their own bodies and the process of childbirth, and to accompany them on the miraculous and transformative journey of pregnancy, birth and all that comes after.

    Yoga came on my path when I was working in a multinational corporation. It was love at first sight. After a while I realized yoga was actually changing the direction of my life and I chose to take a leap into the unknown and ended up graduating as a yoga teacher with the International School of Hatha Yoga Madrid.
    </p>
    <p class="large text-muted">
    During my first pregnancy I combined my passion for yoga and anatomy with a comprehensive view of pregnancy and birth. I specialised as a teacher of prenatal and postpartum yoga with OMMA School (Montse Cob) in Madrid.
    </p>
    <p class="large text-muted">
    I continue my learning on a regular basis through courses and workshops (The biomechanics of the pelvis. G.D.S. Method and Muscular Chains; Intensive workshops with teachers such as Donna Farhi).
    </p>
    <p class="large text-muted">
    Currently, I am studying to become a midwife (Maastricht University of Applied Sciences). I also teach prenatal yoga, childbirth education courses, and work as a doula assisting childbirth and postpartum, while raising my two beautiful sons.
