I help women on their jouney of becoming more aware, concious, at ease and confident with their bodies, cycles and their being by offering resources for addressing physical health through a suited, responsible and tailor made practice of yoga and other movement techniques, practice of mindfulness, meditation, ralaxation and other lifestyle changing practices.
