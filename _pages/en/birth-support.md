# Doula support

It's impossible to predict or control how birth and labour will go. Will you connect emotionally with your labour and midwife, and will she have time for you? How will you react to the intensity of labour? Will your labour be smooth or long and drawn-out? How will your husband or partner hold up under the pressure?

Faced with these uncertainties, **many women find reassurance in having a doula by their side**. During labour and birth, a doula provides constant, knowledgeable support. She can make suggestions about positions during labour, help you with breathing through contractions, and provide massage. She can also answer questions you and your partner have about what's happening.

## How does it work?

* Initial meeting
* One or two prenatal visits at your home
* Continuous labour and birth support (regardless of the length of labour) and at least the first 1 ½ hours postpartum
* Two postpartum visits

The initial meeting is an opportunity to get to know each other and be sure we are a right fit.  The people you choose to have at your birth must be the right people for you. I respect that you may feel another doula would be a better fit, please respect your own feelings and go with what feels good to you.

The in-person prenatal visit at your home will include a detailed discussion of your plans for your birth and your expectations of me as a doula.  We will also discuss informed decision making and strategies to manage the intensity of labour.

Labour support can start as early as you feel you need support. I will be on call 24 hours from 37-42 weeks. You call when you feel you may be in labour or need to speak with me. You decide when you want me to come over to your home. From there I will stay with you for at least 1 ½ hours after the birth or until you feel you no longer need support. I will support you and your partner with practical information and hands-on tools such as massage, movement, relaxation and breathing and Mama-TENS. 

I will provide breastfeeding support in the first hour after birth and at your postpartum visit.


## What is a doula or birth coach?

A birth doula is a trained labour coach who assists you during labour and birth. She provides you with continuous emotional support, as well as assistance with other non-medical aspects of your care. 

A doula helps you before labour and birth by answering your questions about what to expect, easing your fears, helping you develop a birth plan, and generally getting you ready for the arrival of your baby.

[Research has found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23076901) that women who have continuous one-on-one support during labour tend to use pain medication less often, have slightly shorter labours, and are less likely to have a c-section or a forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery. Women who have continuous support are also more likely to report being satisfied with their birth experience. It is believed that women who have continuous support produce lower levels of stress hormones during labour than women left alone or attended by inexperienced coaches.
