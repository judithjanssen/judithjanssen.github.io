<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted text-center">I specialize in private lessons because I get to create really specific sessions that help my clients in exactly the way they need in the moment!</h3>

<h2 class="section-heading text-center">Why yoga?</h2>

Well, I´ve always been very physical, even as a girl, I was always running around, doing handstands, climbing trees, and yes, I love working out, dancing, moving in general. But I also went through the whole package: highschool, university, travelling, making career in  multinationals. At that time I felt quite disconnected from myself and disorientated as to where to go from there. And then, in my late twenties, I came across yoga. And for me it really was a revelation.

I think in general, there´s not much attention to breathing while working out, the mind is not always addressed either, and we live in a culture with a “no pain no gain” motto. And I don´t completely agree, because, yes, the feeling that you get after a tough workout is great. But a lot of times, the way we work out can be harmful for your body, and even for your self-image. I think we better work for self-acceptance than for self-improvement, because otherwise your approach will have a negative and destructive character rather than a constructive and loving one.

Even yoga, when practised in a disrespectful way can cause harm to your body, and injury. So, for me, one of the key things in yoga is respect for your body. Yes, you CAN have a tough and exhilarating yoga workout, but always within the boundaries that your body, your constitution sets. 

<h2 class="section-heading text-center">What is your teaching about?</h2>

Respect for your body and empowerment are key elements in my teaching. I love anatomy, and I pay a lot of attention to restoring a proper posture and individual alignment, which means establishing a balanced alignment for YOUR specific body.

When your are properly aligned, it´s much easier to breath, because there´s much more space for breathing. Lots of people have distorted breathing patterns, so one of the things I usually work on is releasing the muscles involved in breathing, such as the diaphragm. 

Also, lot of back problems come from poor posture combined with unbalanced muscle chains and even poor breathing, so, in effect, if you start working with posture you really address loads of other issues. What makes yoga often so effective is the combination of strengthening muscles that are in charge of maintaining posture and releasing strained muscles, while paying attention to the breath.

<h2 class="section-heading text-center">Why private classes?</h2>

I think the future of yoga is specialisation. Yoga is a great way to keep body and mind balanced, fit and happy. But, each body is different, and what makes a balanced practice for one person might not be that balancing for another. Also, many people suffer from specific pains or discomforts, and teaching a general practice for a group makes it more difficult to address the specific needs of an individual.

So what I´m seeing in my private teaching is that because of the fact that you can adapt the practice completely to a specific person, the benefits are even greater than in a regular yoga class. 

<h2 class="section-heading text-center">What kind of people would look for private classes?</h2>

I think that private classes are especially beneficial for yoga students that look for a challenging but at the same time very respectful and focused workout, but also for people that are suffering from specific discomforts that need a personal approach. Also, I have students that prefer to have their yoga practice in the comfort of their own house, or at certain hours that are normally not that common for group classes. For example, I have students that prefer to practice yoga early in the morning of during lunchtime at their office. So, private classes are flexible and easy to fit in your schedule.
